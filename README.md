# AccountTool
A tool for saving accounts made in Kotlin

This is my first Kotlin project. Its made in IntelIJ. If you want to contribute feel free to do so! 
To get the jar just run: 'mvn package' and there you go!

The tool makes a folder under documents called accounttool with a json file in it. It is not yet encrypted or atleast the objects arent.
I will be taking a look at this and maybe even implementing it for extra security. The tool is very easy to use!

I will also make a release with the jar and an .exe
